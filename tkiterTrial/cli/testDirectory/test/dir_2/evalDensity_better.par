Notes:
- 'what to put into': 1st and 2nd column are the x and y coords.
what comes into 3rd, 4th, ... column can be directed by the following codes
 0	constant (everytime = 1.00)
		1	particle density
		2	spin density
		3	spin-down density
		4	Sz density
		5	spin density/particle density
		6	spin-down density/particle density
		7	Sz density/particle density
