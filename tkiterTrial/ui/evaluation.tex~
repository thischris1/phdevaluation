The data presented in Fig. \ref{} describes the deviation of the ACF from a symmetric gaussian function with increasing width of the individual scatterer. While for small impurities ($\sigma < 0.2 l_{0}$) the ACF is purely gaussian with $\sigma_{x}=\sigma_{y} =l_{corr}^{1D}$ . For wider impurities ($\sigma > 0.4 l_{0}$) the ACF is not a symmetric gaussian anymore, hence the fitted values scatter strongly.
