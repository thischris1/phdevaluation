For the generation of this plot we calculated and evaluated 50 background potentials from identicals sets of $N_{scatt} =4000$, $V_{max} = 0.1$ and the respective $\sigma$. For the potentials with the largest and smallest correlation length, we show the correlation lengths as calculated from a 1D fit of the ACF, and the two width $\sigma_{x,y}$ as calculated from a 2D gaussian fit to the ACF.
